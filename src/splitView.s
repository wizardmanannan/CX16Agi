_bESplitCel: ;The goal of this function is to PREPARE to split a cel into segments that can be drawn to the vera. The segments are stored in banked memory, and the pointers to the segments are stored in the cel struct
;There are two split cel methods, this one for preparation and bCSplitCel for splitting.
;;There are two main area of memory dealt with here. The buffer refers to the large temp. buffer on bank C used by the split function. The buffer is never cleared, only overwritten with new data, so there may be stale data on the end. 
;The code knows when to stop reading the buffer by the end addresses as calculated during the execution of bCSplitCel.
;The format of the buffer and allocated memory is: address of segment 0 (two bytes) . . . address of no segments - 1, data. 
;The addresses point to somewhere in the data.
; Note the buffer is never cleared so not all of the data is used
;Allocated memory refers to the block
; of dynamic memory allocated as the permanent storage location of the data.
;This method has several steps, in this order.
; 1. Read the cel struct to get the width, height, and cel data address and bank
; 2. Divide the memory by the number of segments
; 3. Now partition the bCSplitBuffer buffer into equal sized segments to the allocated memory. Note even though this buffer is larger then the allocated memory, any excess space will be discounted. This allows for the pointers to both buffers to point to the same data eg. the first pointer in the allocated memory will point to the first segment in the buffer will point the same data as the first pointer for the buffer and so on
; 4. Store the pointers to the divisions of bCSplitBuffer buffer in bCSplitBufferSegments
; 5. Call bCSplitCel
; 6. Determine how much dynamic memory needs to be allocated to permanently store the data, we can't just copy the data from the buffer because there are huge gaps. Then copy to the allocated memory
